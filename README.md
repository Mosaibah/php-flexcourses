# PHP Course
This repository contains the code I wrote while taking the [PHP Course](https://www.flexcourses.com/courses/php-intensive) on [Flexcourses.com](Flexcourses.com)
with instructor [Abdulmogeeb](https://twitter.com/Abdulmogeeb).
The course covered various topics related to PHP development, including:
- What is logic and how to use it
- How to work with arrays
- Types of loops and how to use them
- Writing custom functions
- Handling forms
- Uploading files to the website
- Data validation
- Sending emails
- Sessions and cookies
- Identifying and exploiting website vulnerabilities
- Protecting against vulnerabilities
- Connecting web applications to MySQL databases
- User authentication
- Building authentication forms
- Building an admin panel
- Authorization and permissions

## I highly recommend taking this course if you:

- Have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Wish to gain a solid understanding of the fundamentals of backend web development using PHP.
